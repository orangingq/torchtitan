Tips:
- MMLU is usually run with 5-shot: --num_fewshot 5
- To see all available task keys: python -m lm_eval --tasks list
- For MATH errors, try replacing 'math' with 'hendrycks_math' in --tasks
- If VRAM is low: use --batch_size 1, --dtype float16/bfloat16, --device_map auto
✅ Evaluation completed for all models. Logs saved in /opt/dlami/nvme/DMLAB/shcho/torchtitan/logs/h200/1024_llama8b/eval.
