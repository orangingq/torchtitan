generation_kwargs: {'max_new_tokens': 512, 'temperature': 0.0} specified through cli, these settings will update set parameters in yaml tasks. Ensure 'do_sample=True' for non-greedy decoding!
Detected kernel version 5.4.0, which is below the recommended minimum of 5.5.0; this can cause the process to hang. It is recommended to upgrade the kernel to the minimum version or higher.
`torch_dtype` is deprecated! Use `dtype` instead!

Tips:
- MMLU is usually run with 5-shot: --num_fewshot 5
- To see all available task keys: python -m lm_eval --tasks list
- For MATH errors, try replacing 'math' with 'hendrycks_math' in --tasks
- If VRAM is low: use --batch_size 1, --dtype float16/bfloat16, --device_map auto
